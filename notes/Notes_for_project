Command (cmd) notes and ideas for use.
Cmd.cmdqueue
A list of queued input lines. The cmdqueue list is checked in cmdloop() when new input is needed; if it is nonempty, its elements will be processed in order, as if entered at the prompt.

Cmd.intro
A string to issue as an intro or banner. May be overridden by giving the cmdloop() method an argument.

Circular Imports:
Circular imports occur when two or more modules depend on each other. This can be tricky and lead to import errors.
Solution:
Use import statements inside functions or methods, where they are only executed when the function is called.
Reorganize your code to reduce dependencies between modules.
