Command (cmd) notes and ideas for use.
Cmd.cmdqueue
A list of queued input lines. The cmdqueue list is checked in cmdloop() when new input is needed; if it is nonempty, its elements will be processed in order, as if entered at the prompt.

Cmd.intro
A string to issue as an intro or banner. May be overridden by giving the cmdloop() method an argument.
